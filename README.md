# JumpingGame
A Windows Phone game quite inspired by the WarioWare game Skateboarding.

Note that these are the source files for the game, not the entire project file.  This means that you must first create a PhoneDirect3D project and then add these files into the appropriate folder.

## How to Play
Play by swiping up on your phone to jump.  If you fall into a gap between the buildings, you lose.  The longer you can stay alive, the higher your score, but note that the game gets faster the longer it goes on.
